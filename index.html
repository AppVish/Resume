    <h2>Projects :</h2>
    <p><b>Mask Detection System (B. Tech Final Year Project)</b><br />
    <ul>
        <li>During my final year, I was part of a team that developed a system capable of identifying individuals not
            wearing face masks. This project was aimed at raising safety awareness amidst health crises. My role
            involved utilizing my moderate
            skills in Java, C, and SQL to contribute to the system's development. The project served as a valuable
            learning experience, helping me enhance my problem-solving and programming skills. Working as part of a
            diverse team also improved my
            communication and coordination abilities. Although the system was only tested in a controlled environment,
            it demonstrated potential for real-world application.
